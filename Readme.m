%% Outlier Elimination
% Outliers are eliminated from the initial data. The are not eliminated in
% subsequent statistics.

%% Sheet Evenness
% Sheet evenness is calculated from the varaibility between the summary of
% the patches across all sheets. Spatial accuracy is the spread of the
% cross-sheet means across all patches. Spatial precision is the spread
% of the cross-sheet spread across all patches. The mean and spread is
% first detemined for every single patch by taking the values across
% all sheets for each patch.

%% Sheet Repeatability
% Sheet repeatability is calculated from the variability between the
% summary of the sheets across all patches. Temporal accruacy is the
% spread of the cross-patch means across all sheets. Temporal precision
% is the spread of the cross-patch spread across all sheets.. The mean and
% spread is first determined for every single sheet by taking the
% values across all the patches for each sheet.

%% Region Evenness
% Region evenness is calculated from the varaibility between the summary of
% the patches within a given region across all sheets. Spatial region
% accuracy is the spread of the cross-sheet means across all patches
% within the region. Spatial region precision is the spread of the
% cross-sheet spread across all patches within the region. The mean and
% spread is first detemined for every single patch within the region by
% taking the values across all sheets for each patch.

%% Region Repeatability
% Region repeatability is calculated from the variability between the
% summary of the sheets across all patches within a given region.
% Temporal region accruacy is the spread of the cross-patch means
% across all sheets for the patches in the region. Temporal precision
% is the spread of the cross-patch spread across all sheets for the
% patches in the region. The mean and spread is first determined for
% every single sheet by taking the values across all the patches within
% the reagion for each sheet.

%% Directional Evenness
% Directional evenness is the variability between the band evenness values
% of the all the bands in a given direction (axial or circumferential).
% Spatial directional accruacy is the spread of the means across bands.
% Spatial directional precision is the spread of the spread across bands.

%% Directional Repeatability
% Directional repeatability is the variability between the band
% repeatability values of the all the bands in a given direction (axial
% or circumferential). Temporal direction accruacy is the spread of the
% means across bands. Temporal precision is the spread of the spread
% across the bands.
