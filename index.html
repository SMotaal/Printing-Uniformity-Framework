        <h3>Printing Uniformity Analyzer</h3>

<p>This software is designed to analyze the uniformity of the inking of printing systems using the Printing Uniformity Framework developed by Saleh Abdel Motaal (<a href="https://github.com/daflair" class="user-mention">@daflair</a>) and Franz Sigg (<a href="https://github.com/FranzSigg" class="user-mention">@FranzSigg</a>).</p>

<p>The Printing Uniformity Framework attempts to characterize and compare systems regardless of the format, printing process and press design using both densitometry and colorimetry. Custom-coded PostScript checkerboard test target is adjusted to accommodate different press sizes which are then scanned using automated spectrophotometry.</p>

<h4>Core Functions</h4>

<p>Millions of data points are recorded for thousands of patches 50 or more press sheets to capture the consistency of ink transfer for solids and halftone steps. Custom tethering with an automated spectrophotometer is used for this daunting chore of collecting data. Statistical analysis models are used to distill the massive data for each test case in order to represent the performance of systems in comparable terms. Interactive 3D visualization and time-lapse animations are used to scan the data for anomalies. Interactive and static 2D visual summaries are also generated for communication and reporting purposes incorporating variability profiles on both spatial and temporal domains.</p>

<p>MatLab is used in the research and development of the UniformPrinting toolbox.</p>
